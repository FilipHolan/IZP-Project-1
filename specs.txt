STARTUP

A - 
    gather data from adresses file - array of strings - all have to be converted to lowercase to maintain case insensitivity
    Figure out how to separate them from the given file - maybe use that they are separated by  \n?


B - 
    get user input (file argument, the only one thats supposed to be there, if isnt at all, suppose it an empty string and give all options)




algorithm:

[user input = 0 letters = INPUT]

iterate through all the adresses in adress file, and get all their first letters into LETTER_LIST. Use that for <OUTPUT 2>



[user input = N letters = INPUT]

for each adress, check if its first N letters are equal to INPUT. All that are found should be put into a separate LIST for now.
If no matching adresses are found, skip to <OUTPUT 3>

If the LIST has only one element, skip to <OUTPUT 1>

If it has multiple elements:
From the LIST, get all the second letters, and put them into LETTER_LIST.
This letter list now has to be converted into a single STRING of uppercase letters.
This STRING is then used for <OUTPUT 2>
ALSO if LIST has multiple elements, but one of them matches INPUT exactly, use both <OUTPUT 1> and <OUTPUT 2> in that order


OUTPUTS
1. Adresa nalezena

    Nalezena pouze jedna adresa, která má jako prefix vstupní řetězec
     -> Found: <ta jedna celá odpovídající adresa>


2. Adresa vyžaduje specifikaci

    Nalezeno více adres, které mají jako prefix vstupní řetězec
    ->  Enable: <capitalized letters that could be used to get all possible adresses, no spaces between them>


3. Adresa nenalezena

    -> Not found
